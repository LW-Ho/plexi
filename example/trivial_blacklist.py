	Usage example of RiSCHER API v0.4. Each node is scheduled and assigned with:

	- two :class:`core.slotframe.Slotframe`. One slotframe for Broadcast :class:`core.slotframe.Cell` of length 25 slots and another slotframe for Unicast :class:`core.slotframe.Cell` of length 21 slots.
	- one broadcast cell and one unicast cell
	- one observer for the children list
	- one observer for PRR and RSSI statistics

	Nodes are allocated cells starting from channel 0 and slot 1. Priority is given to fill in the channels before another
	slot is used. Given an intended link between two nodes, the :class:`TrivialScheduler` checks all channels of a slot to
	find possible conflicts or interferences with other transmissions. If none of the two, the link is allocated a cell on
	that slot, if available. Otherwise, the next slot is checked.
